Based on the information in your dataframe, here are some tables you could create:

Book Table: This table would contain information about each book, such as the bookID, title, average_rating, num_pages, ratings_count, text_reviews_count, publication_date, publisher, language_name, author, and genre.

Author Table: This table would contain information about each author, such as their name, bio, and any other relevant information.

Genre Table: This table would contain information about each genre, such as the genreID, name, description, and any other relevant information.

Publisher Table: This table would contain information about each publisher, such as the publisherID, name, location, and any other relevant information.

You could also create additional tables based on your specific needs, such as a customer table if you have information about the customers who purchased the books or a sales table if you have information about the sales of the books.
